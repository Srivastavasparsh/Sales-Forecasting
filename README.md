Sales Forecasting for Restaurant Items
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and forecast sales of various items across multiple restaurants using historical sales data. Accurate demand forecasting is critical for business planning such as production, staffing, and inventory management. The analysis and forecasting models help Fresh Analytics to predict future sales trends and make data-driven decisions in a competitive market environment.
Business Scenario
Businesses face dynamic market conditions where effective decision-making depends on robust sales forecasting models. This project focuses on predicting item demand in different restaurants to support operational and strategic planning.
Dataset
The project works with three main datasets:
	•	restaurants.csv: Details of the restaurants including unique IDs and names.
	•	items.csv: Information about menu items including calories, cost, and store affiliation.
	•	sales.csv: Time-stamped sales data listing item counts sold per day and prices.
Objectives
	•	Import and preprocess the datasets including merging them into a unified format.
	•	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand sales patterns across dates, stores, and items.
	•	Build and compare machine learning models (linear regression, random forest, XGBoost) for sales prediction.
	•	Develop a deep learning LSTM model for advanced time series forecasting.
	•	Evaluate model performances with metrics such as RMSE and MAPE.
	•	Generate sales forecasts for future periods.
Project Structure
	•	notebooks/ : Contains Jupyter notebooks for EDA, model building, and analysis.
	•	data/ : Raw and processed datasets used in the project.
	•	scripts/ : Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
	•	models/ : Saved model files and related artifacts.
	•	README.md : Project overview and instructions.
Usage
Steps to reproduce the analysis:
	•	Clone the repository.
	•	Install required dependencies (specified in environment.yml or requirements.txt).
	•	Run notebooks or scripts in order to explore data, train models, and generate forecasts.
Evaluation
Model performances are evaluated using RMSE for machine learning models and MAPE for deep learning. The best performing model is used for final forecasting.
Future Work
	•	Further tuning and testing of forecasting models.
	•	Integration with real-time data sources for live sales predictions.
	•	Extend analysis to additional variables affecting sales.
